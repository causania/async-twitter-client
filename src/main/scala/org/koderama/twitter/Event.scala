/**
 * Returns public statuses that match one or more filter predicates. At least one predicate parameter, follow,
 * locations, or track must be specified. Multiple parameters may be specified which allows most clients to use a
 * single connection to the Streaming API. Placing long parameters in the URL may cause the request to be rejected
 * for excessive URL length. Use a POST request header parameter to avoid long URLs.
 * <p>
 * The default access level allows up to 400 track keywords, 5,000 follow userids and 25 0.1-360 degree location
 * boxes.
 * </p>

 * @param params
 *            possible parameters: count, delimited, follow, locations and track

/**
 * Returns a random sample of all public statuses. The default access level, ‘Spritzer’ provides a small proportion
 * of the Firehose, very roughly, 1% of all public statuses. The “Gardenhose” access level provides a proportion
 * more suitable for data mining and research applications that desire a larger proportion to be statistically
 * significant sample. Currently Gardenhose returns, very roughly, 10% of all public statuses. Note that these
 * proportions are subject to unannounced adjustment as traffic volume varies.
